Studying and learning quantum computation

This repository serves a simple function: I am a physicist currently learning quantum computation and will upload whatever code I end up using in the process.

## What I'm using
- Programming language: Python, with the Qiskit package.
- OS: Windows 10
- IDE: Well, anything works actually. I'll be just using SublimeText for now. 
- References: M.A. Nielsen, Quantum Computation and Information. The Qiskit documentation (https://qiskit.org/documentation)

## What I'll be actually uploading
I'm skipping the actual quantum mechanics behind the processes. If any of you wish to learn more about it, I highly recommend Rae's Quantum Mechanics. While not the best mathematically, in conceptual terms it's a good book and a decent read.

## PDF versions

2019-12-30: First upload. Introducing the concept of qubit, the Bloch sphere and single qubit quantum gates.
